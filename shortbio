a short bio about yourself.
i love technology, especially in electronics, i want to be an engineer. 
i am strong but my anxiety is stronger.
I love science because of its practical usefulness in life.
Because I love science, I also almost almost almost somewhat probably like math because science needs hardcore math to describe relationships.
I WANNA BE THE VERY BEST, LIKE NO ONE EVER WAS.
